# SMART SECURITY SYSTEM BASED ON EDGE COMPUTING AND FACE RECOGNITION



## Introduction
This project aims to develop a security and surveillance system using edge AI technologies. The system utilizes a Raspberry Pi board equipped with a camera module, microphone, and door sensor to monitor and secure a physical space. Edge AI algorithms analyze video and audio inputs for security threats and trigger alerts when unauthorized access is detected. The project also integrates cloud-based services for model training and data storage.
